Huffman Compression File Format

	Binary Tree as 1's and 0's
		if the first bit is a 1, use the built in Huffman Tree
		000101111
		Makes the binary Tree
				   0
				0     0
			  1   0  1 1
				 1 1
		As letters
				   0
				0     0
			  a   0  b c
				 d e
		Read the binary tree until we get down to a level containing all ones
		keep vount of the number of ones we see. this is called "z"

	Characters shown in the binary tree
		XXXXXXXX repeated z times

	Compressed Data
		Unknown length
		Traverse the binary tree until we hit a hex value, then write that to
		the uncompressed output stream

	Padding Bits
		XXXXXXXX numbering the amount of bits prior to this byte to ignore.
